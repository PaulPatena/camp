I chose Vuetify in this solution as it provides a Material Design Component implementation,
plus Vue JS comes with 1st party state-mgmt and router thus reducing boiler plate code by a LOT.

My solution is reponsive, works in mobile as well.
Support dark mode as my eyes personally have issues with very bright displays.

In the home page, it will show a spinner while fetching data.
